title: "VBR Calculator examples"
---

The `vbr/Projects/` folder contains a number of "Projects", each of which is a self contained example of using the VBR Calculator in various ways.

* [`vbr/Projects/vbr_core_examples`](/vbr/examples/vbrcore/): simple scripts that call various methods of the VBR Calculator.

* `vbr/Projects/1_LabData/1_Attenuation`: calculates elastic moduli and attenuation at laboratory conditions.

* `vbr/Projects/mantle_extrap_LUT`: generates a look-up table (LUT) of material properties for a plausible range of mantle temperature, melt fraction and grain size.

* `vbr/Projects/mantle_extrap_hspace`: generates material properties for thermondynamic state variables given by an ananlytical model of half-space cooling.

* `vbr/Projects/mantle_extrap_FM`: generates material properties for thermondynamic state variables given by a numerical forward model (FM) of half-space cooling.

* `vbr/Projects/runThermalModel`: examples of running the forward model used by `vbr/Projects/mantle_extrap_FM`.

* `vbr/Projects/LAB_fitting_bayesian`: a Bayesian fitting exercise for asthenosphere shear wave velocity, LAB depth and Q as a function of temperature, grain size and melt fraction.
