title: "About the VBR Calculator"
---

The **Very Broadband Rheology (VBR)** Calculator provides a useful framework for calculating material properties from thermodynamic state variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, melt fraction, grain size) using a wide range of experimental scalings. The VBR Calculator at present contains constitutive models only for olivine, but may be applied to other compositions (at your own risk). The main goal is to allow easy comparison between methods for calculating anelastic-dependent seismic properties, but the VBR Calculator can also be used for calculating steady state viscosity, pure elastic (anharmonic) seismic properties and more. It can be used to fit and analyze experimental data, infer thermodynamic state from seismic measurements, predict measurable properties from geodynamic models, for example.
