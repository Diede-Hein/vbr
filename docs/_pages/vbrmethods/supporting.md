In addition to the methods for calculating viscous, elastic and anelastic properties, there are a number of additional functions that may be useful to the user:

* `SolLiquidus()` (documentation)[/vbr/support/solliq/]: calculates a peridotite solidus with optional dependence on volatile content.
* `ThermodynamicProps()` (documentation)[/vbr/support/thermoprops/]: calculates some additional thermodynamic properties (density, specific heat and thermal conductivity) as a function of temperature and pressure
